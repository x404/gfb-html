<h1>Anti-money Laundering</h1>
<p>Worldwide Markets Limited does not tolerate money laundering and supports the fight against money launderers. Worldwide Markets Limited follows the guidelines set by the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group. </p>

<p>Worldwide Markets Limited has policies in place to deter people from laundering money. These policies include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ensuring clients have valid proof of identification</li>
	<li>maintaining records of identification information</li>
	<li>determining that clients are not known or suspected terrorists by checking their names against lists of known or suspected terrorists</li>
	<li>informing clients that the information they provide may be used to verify their identity</li>
	<li>closely following clients' money transactions</li>
	<li>Not accepting cash, money orders, third party transactions, exchange houses transfers or Western Union transfers. </li>
</ul>

<p>Money laundering occurs when funds from an illegal/criminal activity are moved through the financial system in such a way as to make it appear that the funds have come from legitimate sources. Money Laundering usually follows three stages:</p>

<ul>
	<li>firstly, cash or cash equivalents are placed into the financial system</li>
	<li>secondly, money is transferred or moved to other accounts (e.g. futures accounts) through a series of financial transactions designed to obscure the origin of the money (e.g. executing trades with little or no financial risk or transferring account balances to other accounts)</li>
	<li>And finally, the funds are reintroduced into the economy so that the funds appear to have come from legitimate sources (e.g. closing a futures account and transferring the funds to a bank account). Trading accounts are one vehicle that can be used to launder illicit funds or to hide the true owner of the funds. In particular, a trading account can be used to execute financial transactions that help obscure the origins of the funds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Worldwide Markets Limited direct funds withdrawals back to the original source of remittance, as a preventative measure.</p>
<p>International Anti-money Laundering requires financial services institutions to be aware of potential money laundering abuses that could occur in a customer account and implement a compliance program to deter, detect and report potential suspicious activity.</p>
<p>These guidelines have been implemented to protect Worldwide Markets Limited and its clients.</p>
